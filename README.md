# watch-mubi-together

Watch Mubi Together is a Chrome extension that enables Mubi users to watch movies together with synchronized playback. 


## Specification

Here's a high-level specification:

1. **User Authentication:** Users must log in to their Mubi accounts through the extension to access the synchronized playback feature.

2. **Room Creation and Management:** Users can create virtual "rooms" where they can invite friends to join and watch movies together. The creator of the room acts as the host.

3. **Room Invitation:** The host can invite friends to the room through shareable links or by sending direct invitations to other Mubi users.

4. **Synchronized Playback:** When in a room, all users should experience synchronized playback of the selected movie. Playback controls (play, pause, seek) should apply to all users simultaneously.

5. **Real-time Chat:** Include a real-time chat feature so that users in the room can communicate with each other while watching the movie together.

6. **Playback Control Permission:** Only the room host or designated users should have playback control. Others can only control playback on their own devices.

7. **Handle Network Latency:** Implement mechanisms to handle network latency and ensure playback synchronization among users as much as possible.

8. **Extension UI:** Design a user-friendly and intuitive UI for creating/joining rooms, managing room settings, and controlling playback.

9. **Privacy and Security:** Ensure that the extension respects user privacy and security, adhering to Mubi's policies and not storing any sensitive data.
